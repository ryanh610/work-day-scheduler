# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

For this project, I have created A business hour planner. I have utilized my knowledge in third party APIs- utilizing moment.js to influence my webpage based on time. My method of completing such a function relied heavily on local storage. I completed tasks such as:
- comparing indexes from storage to entries on webpage (this was done to replace an entry that was edited rather than creating a new one)
- Using moment.js to feed time into my webpage
- utilizing the event and value parameters to properly target elements and functions
